## 1 引言

​		JUC包中还有一个并发工具就是CyclicBarrier，能够允许一组线程彼此等待，直到所有线程都到达Barrier才能够继续执行。CyclicBarrier是基于ReentrantLock和Condition实现其原理。

## 2 构造方法

```java
/** The lock for guarding barrier entry */
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(); // 持有ReentrantLock属性
    /** Condition to wait on until tripped */
    private final Condition trip = lock.newCondition(); //条件队列conditon
    /** The number of parties */
    private final int parties;
    /* The command to run when tripped */
    private final Runnable barrierCommand;
    /** The current generation */
    private Generation generation = new Generation();

    /**
     * Number of parties still waiting. Counts down from parties to 0
     * on each generation.  It is reset to parties on each new
     * generation or when broken.
     */
    private int count; //线程个数
```

```java
/**
     * Creates a new {@code CyclicBarrier} that will trip when the
     * given number of parties (threads) are waiting upon it, and which
     * will execute the given barrier action when the barrier is tripped,
     * performed by the last thread entering the barrier.
     *
     * @param parties the number of threads that must invoke {@link #await}
     *        before the barrier is tripped
     * @param barrierAction the command to execute when the barrier is  -- 当所有线程都到达barrier后执行的barrierAction
     *        tripped, or {@code null} if there is no action
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code parties} is less than 1
     */
    public CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction) {
        if (parties <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        this.parties = parties;
        this.count = parties;
        this.barrierCommand = barrierAction;
    }
```



## 3 实现原理

* await

```java
/**
     * Waits until all {@linkplain #getParties parties} have invoked  --阻塞直到所有线程都到达barrier
     * {@code await} on this barrier.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
     * disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
     * one of the following things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The last thread arrives; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * one of the other waiting threads; or
     * <li>Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or
     * <li>Some other thread invokes {@link #reset} on this barrier.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>If the barrier is {@link #reset} while any thread is waiting,
     * or if the barrier {@linkplain #isBroken is broken} when
     * {@code await} is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then
     * {@link BrokenBarrierException} is thrown.
     *
     * <p>If any thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting,
     * then all other waiting threads will throw
     * {@link BrokenBarrierException} and the barrier is placed in the broken
     * state.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
     * non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
     * current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
     * continue.
     * If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
     * will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
     * the broken state.
     *
     * @return the arrival index of the current thread, where index
     *         {@code getParties() - 1} indicates the first
     *         to arrive and zero indicates the last to arrive
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread was interrupted
     *         while waiting
     * @throws BrokenBarrierException if <em>another</em> thread was
     *         interrupted or timed out while the current thread was
     *         waiting, or the barrier was reset, or the barrier was
     *         broken when {@code await} was called, or the barrier
     *         action (if present) failed due to an exception
     */
    public int await() throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException {
        try {
            return dowait(false, 0L);

## 4 特点

```java
/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for  --一种同步机制允许一组线程彼此等待着到达公共的栅栏
 * each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are  -- CyclicBarrier用于处理固定size的线程彼此等待的场景
 * useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
 * must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called   --被叫着“cyclic” 是因为count能够被重置再利用，在被等待线程释放后
 * <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
 * are released.
 *
 * <p>A {@code CyclicBarrier} supports an optional {@link Runnable} command -- CyclicBarrier支持一种可选的Runnable Command 允许执行
 * that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party -- 当最后一个线程到达栅栏的时候
 * arrives, but before any threads are released.
 * This <em>barrier action</em> is useful                              -- barrier action用于更新共享状态
 * for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is an example of using a barrier in a   --样例实践
 * parallel decomposition design:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Solver {
 *   final int N;
 *   final float[][] data;
 *   final CyclicBarrier barrier;
 *
 *   class Worker implements Runnable {
 *     int myRow;
 *     Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
 *     public void run() {
 *       while (!done()) {
 *         processRow(myRow);
 *
 *         try {
 *           barrier.await();
 *         } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *           return;
 *         } catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
 *           return;
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
 *     data = matrix;
 *     N = matrix.length;
 *     Runnable barrierAction =
 *       new Runnable() { public void run() { mergeRows(...); }};
 *     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N, barrierAction);
 *
 *     List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<Thread>(N);
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
 *       Thread thread = new Thread(new Worker(i));
 *       threads.add(thread);
 *       thread.start();
 *     }
 *
 *     // wait until done
 *     for (Thread thread : threads)
 *       thread.join();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
 * barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed --所有的线程都到达栅栏后执行barrier action 
 * the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the    -- （这个action的执行是在await方法里调用的判断count==0）
 * rows. If the merger
 * determines that a solution has been found then {@code done()} will return
 * {@code true} and each worker will terminate.
 *
 * <p>If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
 * it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
 * action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
 * {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
 * You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
 * example:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * if (barrier.await() == 0) {
 *   // log the completion of this iteration
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The {@code CyclicBarrier} uses an all-or-none breakage model
 * for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
 * point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
 * other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
 * abnormally via {@link BrokenBarrierException} (or
 * {@link InterruptedException} if they too were interrupted at about
 * the same time).
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling  --
 * {@code await()}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn
 * <i>happen-before</i> actions following a successful return from the
 * corresponding {@code await()} in other threads.
 *
 * @since 1.5
 * @see CountDownLatch
 *

 */
public class CyclicBarrier {
    /**
     * Each use of the barrier is represented as a generation instance.
     * The generation changes whenever the barrier is tripped, or
     * is reset. There can be many generations associated with threads

     * may be allocated to waiting threads - but only one of these
     * can be active at a time (the one to which {@code count} applies)

## 5 总结

​       CyclicBarrier的计数器可以使用reset方法重置因此可以用于更为复杂的场景，而CountDownLatch的计数器只能用一次。CountDownLatch可以允许一个或多个线程等待一组其他线程场景，而CyclicBarrier是用于一组线程彼此等待，直到所有线程都运行到栅栏才能继续运行。
